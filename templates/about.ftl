		<h1>About VIVO</h1>

			<h2><Strong>What is VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<ul class="answers">
					<li>VIVO is an open, on-line interlinked collection of data and tools for research discovery and scholarship. VIVO represents information about scholars and scholarship--people, grants, scholarly work, resources, events, interests, activities and accomplishments--and their interconnections.

					<li>VIVO is a powerful search tool for precisely locating people, grants, publications, and more.

					<li>The VIVO project is funded by the National Institutes of Health, U24 RR029822, "VIVO: Enabling National Networking of Scientists."

				</ul>

			<h2><strong>Why is this called VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<p>The term "VIVO" is a reference to the term "<em>in vivo</em>," Latin for "within the living." The name was developed at Cornell University in 2003 and seems appropriate for a system devoted to the living, breathing world of research and scholarship.

			<h2><strong>What are the key benefits of VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<ul class="answers">
					<li>VIVO provides information regarding grants, research, resources, publications, and people, enabling research discovery across UF and participating institutions.

					<li>VIVO data is largely obtained using automated methods from public, authoritative sources within and outside an institution. This reduces the effort for faculty and staff to gather and provide data.

					<li>VIVO's search is faceted. This means that if searching for people, you will get a list of people. If searching for grants, you will get a list of grants.

					<li>VIVO information is linked. This means that you can follow links in VIVO from a person to a grant for that person, to other people who work on the same grant, to the department administering the grant, to people in that department, to publications of people in that department, etc. VIVO creates opportunities for open discovery of research connections by following these links.

				</ul>
					
			<h2><strong>Why should I use VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<ul class="answers">
					<li>VIVO is useful for researchers seeking collaborators on inter-disciplinary proposals.

					<li>VIVO can connect multi-disciplinary research groups within an institution.

					<li>VIVO enables promotion of upcoming research and presentations.

					<li>VIVO allows researchers to showcase their credentials.

					<li>Students can use VIVO to search for graduate study mentors and programs.

					<li>VIVO assists research offices in finding researchers with specialized skills or expertise.

		<h1>VIVO Data</h1>

			<h2><strong>How does the VIVO system obtain data?</strong></h2>

				<p>Human resources data, grants, and publications are obtained through automated
processes from HR resources, the Division of Sponsored Research, and PubMed.</p>

				<p>VIVO profiles can also be edited manually by faculty and staff. The VIVO team is
collecting faculty and staff CVs and will enter data in the 6 following fields: educational
background, previous positions, research interests, awards, photo, and alternate email
addresses. Please send this information and a picture to: <a href="mailto:vivo@uflib.ufl.edu">vivo@uflib.ufl.edu</a>.</p>

			<h2><strong>Are there plans to add additional data to VIVO from other sources?</strong></h2>

				<p>Yes. VIVO has completed negotiations with Thomson-Reuters and will be adding publication data from Web of Science to VIVO. GatorOne Photos and Registrar data regarding courses taught are also being added. Additionally, VIVO is working on tools for adding databases of citations from tools such as EndNote, RefWorks, bibtex, and Zotero.</p>

			<h2><strong>How much information is stored in VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<p>UF VIVO currently contains information on over 13,000 faculty and staff, 16,000 grants, 13,000 publications and 5,000 organizations--within and beyond UF.</p>

			<h2><strong>How much CV information has been entered into VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<p>Information from over 800 CVs have been entered. We enter information from between 30-40 CVs per week on average. The VIVO team is collecting faculty and staff CVs and will enter data into VIVO for the <b>6</b> <b>following fields</b>: educational background, previous positions, research interests, awards, photo, and alternate email addresses. Please send this information and a picture to: <a href="mailto:vivo@uflib.ufl.edu">vivo@uflib.ufl.edu</a>. </p>

			<h2><strong>Will VIVO automatically provide photos of people from UF?</strong></h2>

				<p>The VIVO team is working with the Business Services Division to provide GatorOne photos on every VIVO profile that does not already have a photo. Of course, you can edit your profile at any time to provide a photo of your choice. </p>

			<h2><strong>Is VIVO a system of record?</strong></h2>

				<p>VIVO is not a system of record for the majority of the information it contains. It collects and organizes information from other systems. Some elements of a user’s profile may reside only in VIVO. These include short bio statements, research interests, and
geographic areas of focus.</p>

			<h2><strong>If I edit my profile, will my changes be overridden by automatic data updates?</strong></h2>

				<p>No. VIVO keeps track of what you have edited and does not allow it to be overridden by automatic updates. </p>

			<h2><strong>Will "Courses Taught" be added to VIVO?</strong></h2>

				<p>Yes. We are working with the Office of the University Registrar to add this data to VIVO.</p>

			<h2><strong>If I have a personal database of my publications in EndNote, RefWorks, BibTex, Zotero, or similar personal database, can
these be imported to VIVO?</h2>
				<p>We will provide an automatic import for all personal databases compliant with the
Library of Congress MODS standard (http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/).</p>

			<h2><strong>How does VIVO address privacy issues?</strong></h2>

				<p>VIVO contains only public data pertaining to research and scholarship activities. No sensitive information is stored in VIVO. </p>

			<h2><strong>I have software that might be useful to the VIVO project. How can I help?</strong></h2>
